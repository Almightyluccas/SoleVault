WORK IN PROGRESS STILL

This is my first full-stack e-commerce website that focuses on the sale of shoes. For the backend, I employed vanilla PHP with the MVC architecture and utilized MySQL for efficient database management. On the frontend, I leveraged JavaScript, CSS, and Bootstrap to enrich the user interface and ensure an engaging experience. To deliver a seamless user journey, I incorporated AJAX calls, particularly in the Cart feature, enabling real-time updates to the UI without requiring page refreshes.
